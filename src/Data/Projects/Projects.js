Most of the time I worked on the dashboard, which contains the vertical navigation, the list of own decks, the recent decks and the possibility to create new decks. The thing I'm most proud of in this project is the Game Mode, which you can use with your own decks as well as with public decks to test your knowledge in the respective subject.",
